<h3>31/12/19 - Unprecedented influx peak</h3>

Dear users, we are facing an unprecedented situation with a very big influx of users these last two days, especially on the android platform.
<br>We are investigating to find out the source of it which may be a newspaper/social network article, a typical end of the year event or a robot fetching information from MFFG database. If you have any information please let us know.
<br>We would like to remind hackers that MFFG service is free and thus cannot sustain external fetch on the database. If the influx persists, we would have to take severe measures.
